	•	Productionized the ops reporting pipeline: committed dashboard source, stabilized Git history, and ensured weekly rollups are versioned and deployable.
	•	Hardened Git workflow: resolved remote sync issues, clarified tracking state, and confirmed clean main branch alignment with origin.
	•	Established daily capture habit infrastructure: added new_daily_note.sh, verified weekly rollup automation, and confirmed localhost dashboard integration path.
